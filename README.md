# Microsoft Imagine Cup — Banjeer
This is our repository for our product, **Banjeer**!

The flood in Jakarta has been a recurring problem since the 17th century. Furthermore, the flood in Jakarta is still happening annually, and climate change makes the matter even worse every year.

Banjeer came up as the countermeasure of floods by utilizing Computer Vision to monitor the condition of rivers from satellite images. We aim to help various stakeholders in the mitigation, preparation, and response to Jakarta’s annual flood. 

Automating the river condition detection will help the government reduce the capital, time, and human resources spent on the annual flood countermeasure. The web is also equipped with features to foster Jakarta’s citizen awareness of its environment. In the short term, we seek to aid the flood mitigation, preparation, and response better. In the long term, however, we expect to stop Jakarta’s annual flood entirely.

We also hope that we can further improve our product so it can help the response to the flood globally, especially in the developing nations. We realize that floods are a major problem globally, especially for developing nations like Indonesia.

Last, **Let the River Flow!**
